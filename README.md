# A-B_testing-Regression-Analysis
This project analyzes multi-year advertising campaign data to determine which platform—Facebook Ads or Google AdWords—is more effective in terms of conversions, clicks, and cost-efficiency. It uses A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling to draw statistically significant conclusions and forecast future performance.


🚀 Key Highlights
✅ A/B Testing: Designed and executed a one-tailed hypothesis test to validate conversion superiority between platforms.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of engagement trends, CPC variability, and ROI using bar charts, distributions, and heatmaps.

🧪 Hypothesis Testing: Found Facebook Ads significantly outperform AdWords in conversions (t = 26.77, p < 0.001).

🔮 Regression Modeling: Built a linear regression model to predict Facebook conversions from clicks with R² = 0.8152 and MSE = 3.88.

📊 Visualization: Created actionable insights through time series analysis, correlation heatmaps, and comparative plots.
